This repository contains the climatic data used in the study entitled "Tropical tree growth sensitivity to climate is driven by species intrinsic growth rate and leaf traits", by Bauman et al. (2021, Global Change Biology).

It contains the plot-specific monthly values of minimum temperature (Tmin) and maximum temperature (Tmax) used to generate mean temperature (Tmean), as well as vapour pressure deficit (VPD), solar radiation (SRAD), precipitation, actual evapotranspiration (aet), and the climatological water deficit (CWD) calculated from precipitation and aet (see Supplementary Methods S2 for associated R code). It also presents the monthly 30-year mean for Tmean, VPD, SRAD, and the maximum CWD (MCWD; MCWD was calculated per plot per year before calculating the 30-year mean, so that every month within a year has the same 30-year mean MCWD) (1981-2010) as well as the standardised monthly anomalies (see Methods).

Tmin, Tmax, Tmean, VPD, SRAD and precipitation were obtained from Anuclimate whereas aet was obtained from TerraClimate (see details and references in Methods of the paper).
