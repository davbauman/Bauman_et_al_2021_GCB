This repository contains the climatic data used in the study entitled "Tropical tree growth sensitivity to climate is driven by species intrinsic growth rate and leaf traits", by Bauman et al. (2021, Global Change Biology).

It contains the plot-specific monthly values of mean temperature (Tmean), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), solar radiation (SRAD), and maximum climatological water deficit (MCWD) calculated from precipitation and aet (see Supplementary Methods S2 for associated R code). It also presents the monthly 30-year mean for Tmean, VPD, SRAD, and MCWD (1981-2010) as well as the standardised monthly anomalies (see Methods for details and references and Supplementary Methods S2 for the associated R code).
